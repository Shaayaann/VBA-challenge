# VBA-challenge
Hello, 
I have uploaded the VBA code (Macro) with .bas extension. I did not have the option to export it as a VBS script, so I think you may need Visual Studio or any other text readers. When you open it as a text, it will add a first line to my code which needed to be removed before running it. 
Thank you so much for your assistance.
